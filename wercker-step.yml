description: |
    Waits for one or more status reports against this commit in GitHub to return
    a success status. The step will succeed when all of the named statuses 
    return success and will fail if one or more of them return failure. It will 
    wait for the configured timeout for status results. 
  
    Note that the step is still subject to Wercker's standard step timeout, so 
    if you wish to configure a timeout longer than Wercker's default 25 minutes,
    you also need to increase Wercker's step timeout accordingly.
